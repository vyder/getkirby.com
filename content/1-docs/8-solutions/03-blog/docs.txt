In this section you’ll learn how to build a blog with Kirby. We’re gonna start with a very basic and minimalistic blog here. For more advanced stuff please check out the subsections.


## Setting up the content

For this example we will use a very simple file structure setup. You can definitely get way more fancy than that, but let’s keep it simple:

(image: 01.png)

First we add a new visible blog folder to our site (04-blog) so it will be visible in our menu. Inside that blog folder we add subfolders for each new article and a `blog.txt`.

### blog.txt

Add two fields to your `blog.txt`:

    Title: Blog
    ----
    Text: This is a nice Demo Blog.
    ----

More on how we use that later when we build our templates.

### Articles

Inside each article folder, add a `blogarticle.txt`. By naming it like this, we can later add a `blogarticle.php` template to our template folder and create a specific template for all articles.

Add three fields to your `blogarticle.txt`


    Title: This is my first Article
    ----
    Date: 08.12.2011
    ----
    Text: Hello World!
    ----


## Building the templates

Add a `blog.php` and a `blogarticle.php` to `site/templates`

(image: 02.png)


### blog.php

This is the template for `http://yourdomain.com/blog`, which will show
a list of all articles.

```php
<?php snippet('header') ?>
<?php snippet('menu') ?>

<section class="content blog">

  <h1><?php echo $page->title()->html() ?></h1>
  <?php echo $page->text()->kirbytext() ?>

  <?php foreach($page->children()->visible()->flip() as $article): ?>

  <article>
    <h1><?php echo $article->title()->html() ?></h1>
    <p><?php echo $article->text()->excerpt(300) ?></p>
    <a href="<?php echo $article->url() ?>">Read more…</a>
  </article>

  <?php endforeach ?>

</section>

<?php snippet('footer') ?>

```

#### Breakin it down a bit...

First we include our header and main menu snippets and start the content section.
By giving the content section a second `blog` selector we can easily style it later in
our css.

```php
<?php snippet('header') ?>
<?php snippet('menu') ?>

<section class="content blog">

```

Next we build the title of our blog and the short description, which we’ve added in `blog.txt`

```php
<h1><?php echo $page->title()->html() ?></h1>
<?php echo $page->text()->kirbytext() ?>

```

The next few lines of code is a loop, where we build a short version for each article of our blog:

```php
<?php foreach($page->children()->visible()->flip() as $article): ?>

<article>
  <h1><?php echo $article->title()->html() ?></h1>
  <p><?php echo $article->text()->excerpt(300) ?></p>
  <a href="<?php echo $article->url() ?>">Read more…</a>
</article>

<?php endforeach ?>

```

#### Breaking it down some more…

With `$page->children()->visible()` we get a set of all visible subpages in our blog folder. This will return the subfolders we got so far in the following order:

    01-your-first-article
    02-your-second-article
    03-your-third-article

But for our blog we want the latest post to be on top, which is 03-your-third-article.
So what we do is to add `->flip()`: `$page->children()->visible()->flip`, which will return the set of pages in reverse order.

    03-your-third-article
    02-your-second-article
    01-your-first-article

Now we can build our foreach loop with that:

```php
<?php foreach($page->children()->visible()->flip() as $article): ?>
…
<?php endforeach ?>

```

Within the foreach loop, we build the html for each article in our list.

```php
<?php foreach($page->children()->visible()->flip() as $article): ?>

<article>
  <h1><?php echo $article->title()->html() ?></h1>
  <p><?php echo $article->text()->excerpt(300) ?></p>
  <a href="<?php echo $article->url() ?>">Read more…</a>
</article>

<?php endforeach ?>

```

Let’s have a close look at the following line:

```php
<p><?php echo $article->text()->excerpt(300) ?></p>

```

In our article list, we don’t want to show the entire content of each article. That would totally mess up our overview. Kirby has a nice little `excerpt()` function, which makes it easy to only show the first few words or sentences of a large article, which is just perfect for our article overview list.

With `$article->text()->excerpt(300)` we get an excerpt with a maximum of 300 characters for each article.

With the next line…

```php
<a href="<?php echo $article->url() ?>">Read more…</a>

```

…we finally link to the full article. For example:

`http://yourdomain.com/blog/your-first-article`

This is where we need the `blogarticle.php` template, which we will build next…


### blogarticle.php

This is going to be super easy. Open `blogarticle.php` in your editor. It will be repsonsible for displaying the detailed view of articles.

The template code for this is very short and easy to understand.

```php
<?php snippet('header') ?>
<?php snippet('menu') ?>

<section class="content blogarticle">
  <article>
    <h1><?php echo $page->title()->html() ?></h1>
    <?php echo $page->text()->kirbytext() ?>

    <a href="<?php echo url('blog') ?>">Back…</a>

  </article>
</section>

<?php snippet('footer') ?>

```

All you need to do is to include the header and menu again as well as the footer snippet at the bottom. In between just add a content section and give it a blogarticle selector so we can add some nice css again later.

The rest is super straight forward. Add the title of your article and the full text of your article and you’re done.

You might also want to add a back link:

```php
<a href="<?php echo url('blog') ?>">Back...</a>
```

which will take your visitors back to the article list.
