With multiple available languages you probably want to provide a way for your users to switch between those languages.

The `$site->languages()` method makes it easy to fetch all information about available languages. Here are two possible ways to implement such a language switch.

## Switch A

The first option is to redirect users to the home page, when they select another language. This can be done by using `$language->url()` for the link.

```php
<nav class="languages" role="navigation">
  <ul>
    <?php foreach($site->languages() as $language): ?>
    <li<?php e($site->language() == $language, ' class="active"') ?>>
      <a href="<?php echo $language->url() ?>">
        <?php echo html($language->name()) ?>
      </a>
    </li>
    <?php endforeach ?>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

## Switch B

The second option is to redirect users to the same page in the selected language. This can be done by using `$page->url($language->code())` for the link.

```php
<nav class="languages" role="navigation">
  <ul>
    <?php foreach($site->languages() as $language): ?>
    <li<?php e($site->language() == $language, ' class="active"') ?>>
      <a href="<?php echo $page->url($language->code()) ?>">
        <?php echo html($language->name()) ?>
      </a>
    </li>
    <?php endforeach ?>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

## PS…

You might have noticed the following in both switches:

```php
<li<?php e($site->language() == $language, ' class="active"') ?>>
```

This line of code will check if the currently active language matches the one, which is just being returned in the loop.

```php
$site->language() == $language
```

The `e()` helper is a Kirby shortcuts to a more complex way of writing an inline if clause:

```php
<?php echo $site->language() == $language ? ' class="active"' : '' ?>
```

The entire code will attach `class="active"` to the list element if the languages match. This makes it possible to style the currently active language in a different way.
