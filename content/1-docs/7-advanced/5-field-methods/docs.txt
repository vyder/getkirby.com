## Using field methods

Kirby 2 comes with a new way to work with fields in templates, by simply chaining helper methods.

### Old way (still works)

```php
<h1><?php echo html($page->title()) ?></h1>
<?php echo kirbytext($page->text()) ?>
```
### New way

```php
<h1><?php echo $page->title()->html() ?></h1>
<?php echo $page->text()->kirbytext() ?>
```

The new way keeps the templates cleaner and is more readable and easier to write. It's also more flexible and can be combined in great ways.

## Available field methods

**For a full (link: docs/cheatsheet/#field-methods text: list of available field methods), please check out the cheat sheet.**

## Getting started

You can extend the set of defined field methods very easily. The best place to do this is in a plugin file: `/site/plugins/methods.php`

```php
field::$methods['quote'] = function($field) {
  return '“' . $field->value . '”';
};
```

This example shows the basic architecture of a field method. You define the method name with the key for the `field::$methods` array. The callback function receives the `$field` object as first argument.

## The field object

The `$field` object gives you access to three important attributes.

- **$field->key**
  *The name of the field*
- **$field->value**
  *The raw content of the field*
- **$field->page**
  *The parent $page object*

**$field->value** can be overwritten with a custom/modified value by your method.

## Return options

There are three common scenarios, what field methods can do:

### 1. Modifying the field for further chaining

```php
field::$methods['quote'] = function($field) {
    $field->value = '“' . $field->value . '”';
    return $field;
};
```
If you want to make it possible that the field value can be further modified by other field methods, you must modify the field value and return the field object.

#### Example

```php
<?php echo $page->title()->quotes()->lower() ?>
```

### 2. Directly returning a modified value

```php
field::$methods['quote'] = function($field) {
    return '“' . $field->value . '”';
};
```

When you directly return the modified value, further chaining is not possible.

#### Example

```php
<?php echo $page->title()->quotes()->lower() ?>
<!-- will throw an error -->

<?php echo $page->title()->quotes() ?>
<!-- will work fine -->

```

### 3. Returning info about the field

```php
field::$methods['hasQuotes'] = function($field) {
    return preg_match('^“.*”$', $field->value);
};
```

Field methods can also be used to make if clauses easier or return info about a value, such as the length or the readingtime.

#### Example

```php
<?php if($page->title()->hasQuotes()) ?>
The title is wrapped in quotes.
<?php endif ?>
```

## Working with method arguments

In some cases it might be helpful to be able to pass arguments to the method:

```php
<?php echo $page->title()->quote('«', '»') ?>
```

The definition for such a method with arguments is very simple:

```php
field::$methods['quote'] = function($field, $start = '“', $end = '”') {
    $field->value = $start . $field->value . $end;
    return $field;
};
```
