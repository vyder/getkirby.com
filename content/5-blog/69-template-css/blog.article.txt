Text: As soon as you start working with multiple templates and a single CSS file for all of them, that file can easily get huge. You will end up with lots of CSS rules, which only apply to a certain template, but will be loaded on every page. This does not really make sense and so it's a good idea to separate template-specific CSS rules. 

With Kirby there are two ways to solve this problem. 

## Plan A

In every template you are probably going to load the header part of your HTML like this: 

```
<?php snippet('header') ?>

<!-- the rest of your template goes here -->

<?php snippet('footer') ?>
```

You can pass variables to snippets with the second argument, so you can simply tell your header, which css to load additionally to your main css file: 

```
<?php snippet('header', array('css' => 'assets/css/myawesome.css')) ?>
```

… and in your header snippet …

```

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  
  <title><?php echo html($site->title()) ?> - <?php echo html($page->title()) ?></title>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />

  <?php echo css('assets/css/styles.css') ?>
  <?php if(isset($css)) echo css($css) ?>

</head>

<body>

```

****

## Plan B: auto-magic

Plan A is nice, but there's a more simple way, which doesn't require to pass the CSS file for each included header.

You can ask for the used template on each page like this: 

```
<?php echo $page->template() ?>
```

This will give you the template name without the PHP extension. So what we need is a little PHP trickery for the header snippet: 

```

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  
  <title><?php echo html($site->title()) ?> - <?php echo html($page->title()) ?></title>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />

  <?php 
  
  echo css('assets/styles/styles.css');
  
  $cssURI  = 'assets/css/' . $page->template() . '.css';
  $cssRoot = c::get('root') . '/' . $cssURI;
  
  if(file_exists($cssRoot)) echo css($cssURI);
  
  ?>

</head>

<body>

```

This code will include the main stylesheet (styles.css) first and then it will try to find a stylesheet in the `assets/css` folder with the name of the current template. If it finds a matching CSS file, it will include that one as well. So all you need to do is to name your templates and stylesheets accordingly. 

For example:

```
/templates/home.php => /assets/css/home.css
/templates/blog.php => /assets/css/blog.css
```

This makes adding custom CSS rules for each template a breeze and you can keep things separated without messing around with one huge CSS file.
