Kirby handles tags or other kinds of multiple data in a single field by simple, comma-separated lists. 

```

Tags: design, photography, architecture

```

Even if this seems to be a very low-tech solution, it can become very versatile and powerful and maybe most important: very, very simple to understand, edit and update

I've written (link: blog/tagcloud text: a tutorial about how to handle tags) with Kirby a few months ago, if you want to learn more about it. 

## Tags in the Panel

If you wanted to edit and add tags in the (link: docs/panel text: Panel), a simple (link: docs/panel/blueprints/field-types text: text field) was the way to go.

This works, but isn't really elegant and it has one big usability issue – you never know, which tags you already entered for other pages or articles, and how you spelled them. 

## A new field to the rescue

It's a hidden secret so far, but the Panel can be extended with new field types very easily.   Fields are built in a plugin-style way and each field can have its own javascript, css and configuration files, together with customizable html. You can find all existing fields in the `panel/fields` folder to see how simple they are constructed.

You could simply just create a new field plugin there, but there's a better way! Each of your projects can have its own custom fields. Just place your own fields in `site/panel/field` If that folder doesn't exist yet, create it.

That way, you never have to touch the core of the panel and you can add as many project-specific fields as you need. 

There's no documentation for creating your own fields yet, but I suggest you simply take existing fields from the panel as inspiration for your own creations. With a little knowledge about PHP/HTML/CSS & JS you should be fine. Docs will follow later. 

## The new tags field

To fix the issue with tag inputs, I've created a field plugin, which you can add to your site by **(link: https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-extensions/tree/master/fields/tags text: downloading it from Github)** and adding it to `site/panel/fields` as described above. Afterwards you can start adding it to your blueprints right away: 

```

fields:
  tags: 
    label: My Tags
    type:  tags

```

*Please read (link: docs/panel/blueprints text: more about blueprint creation) in the docs, if you are just getting started with the Kirby Panel.*

This will render a beautiful new field, which works similar to the email address input on Facebook or tags on Mac OS X:

The tag field will automatically pull tag suggestions for autocompletion from other pages in the same parent folder and from the same field name and display them when you type. 

## Demo

Please feel free to (link: blog/panel-tags-field/demo text: play with the tag field demo) if you are too lazy to add it to the Panel right away :)

## Field Options

The field has a set of options to customize it and fit it to your project. 

### index

You can choose between three different options where to get tag suggestions from: 

1. *siblings*

	The plugin will check all siblings in the same parent folder to look for tag suggestions. 

2. *template*

	The plugin will check through all pages of your site and select tags from those with the same template – no matter where they are located. 

3. *all*

	The plugin will fetch tags from all pages

#### Example

```
fields:
  tags: 
    label: My Tags
    type:  tags
    index: template
```

### field

You can choose which field will be used to get tags from other pages. This makes it possible to not only use the tags field for – well, tags – but for all kinds of data from your site

#### Example

```
fields:
  tags: 
    label: My Tags
    type:  tags
    index: template
    field: title
```

*(This will pull titles from all pages with the same template as auto-suggestions)*

### lower

For tags it's often useful to automatically lowercase all tags. 
You can use this option to do that:

#### Example

```
fields:
  tags: 
    label: My Tags
    type:  tags
    lower: true
```

(the resulting tag string will be completely lowercase)

### Separator

Maybe you don't want to separate your data by comma. 
Set the separator character here. 

#### Example

```
fields:
  tags: 
    label:     My Tags
    type:      tags
    separator: ;
```

### data

If you don't want to fetch suggestions from other pages, you can set your own array of strings, which will be used for autocompletion

#### Example

```
fields:
  tags: 
    label: My Tags
    type:  tags
    data: 
      - design
      - architecture
      - photography
      - development
      - web
```


## The Javascript

I created the original version of the tag input plugin for (link: http://zootool.com text: Zootool) over five years ago. 

With this new version I decided to release it as open-source, so anyone can use it for their own projects and help me imporve it. You can download the latest version from Github: <https://github.com/bastianallgeier/tags>

I'm not a specialist with writing jQuery plugins, so if you want to help me make it more compliant with modern jQuery plugin guidelines, I'd appreciate that a lot. 

## Conclusion

The new tag field will give you and your clients a lot of options to easily add tags and all kinds of multiple field data. I hope you will have fun playing with it. Feedback is appreciated as always :)
