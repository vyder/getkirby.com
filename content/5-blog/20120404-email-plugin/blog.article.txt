Sending emails with PHP can be a very exhausting task. This is why there's the new (link: https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-extensions/tree/master/plugins/email text: email plugin) for Kirby. It's a very simple plugin, which you can use to send emails in your templates, snippets or plugins via (link: http://php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php text: PHP's mail function), (link: http://aws.amazon.com/ses/ text: Amazon Simple Email Service) or (link: http://postmarkapp.com/ text: Postmark). 

While the native mail function in PHP will fit most projects, I recommend you give Amazon SES and Postmark a try. Both are fantastic services to send email in a more professional way with analytics, bounce hooks and other great features. Especially when you plan to send more than just a couple emails per month and you want to avoid being blocked by spam filters, you should consider to use one of them. 

## Installation

To install the plugin, copy the (link: https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-extensions/blob/master/plugins/email/email.php text: email.php) to your `site/plugins` folder. Create the folder, if it's not there yet. 

## Configuration

If you plan to use the native mail function, you don't have to configure anything. If you want to use Amazon SES or Postmark, add the following rules to your `site/config/config.php`:

```php

// for amazon ses
c::set('email.use', 'amazon');
c::set('email.amazon.key', 'Your Amazon SES Key');
c::set('email.amazon.secret', 'Your Amazon SES Secret');

// for postmark
c::set('email.use', 'postmark');
c::set('email.postmark.key', 'Your Postmark API Key');

```

You can also set them up both and switch between services when calling the email plugin function. I'll get to that later. 


## How to use the plugin

In your code, you can use the plugin to send an email as easy as this:

```php
<?php 

$send = email(array(
  'to'      => 'John Doe <john@doe.com>',
  'from'    => 'Max Musterman <max@musterman.com>',
  'subject' => 'My first Email',
  'body'    => 'Hello my friend! How are things going?'
));

?>
```

If you setup your Amazon or Postmark account in your config and you added `c::set('email.use', 'amazon')` or `c::set('email.use', 'postmark')`, the email will be sent from either one of those services. Otherwise the email will be sent with `mail()`

### React on sending errors

To check if the email has been sent at all, you can do the following…

```php
<?php 

$send = email(array(
  'to'      => 'John Doe <john@doe.com>',
  'from'    => 'Max Musterman <max@musterman.com>',
  'subject' => 'My first Email',
  'body'    => 'Hello my friend! How are things going?'
));

if(error($send)) {

  // show the response
  a::show($send);

  // or do something else like saying that the email failed
  echo "The email could not be sent";

}

?>
```

With `a::show($send)` you will get the full response of what happened. If you are sending with Postmark or Amazon, the response will be quite detailed. Unfortunately `mail()` is not very verbose when it comes to reporting errors. 

### Email address formats

For `to`, `from` and `replyto` parameters, you can use either the format…

    John Doe <john@doe.com> 
  
…or simply the address… 
  
    john@doe.com
  
Please make sure that the addresses are always valid. Otherwise the plugin will not be able to send the email and will return an error. 

### Switching services

You can always switch between services when calling the email function. You just need to setup the configuration for all services before:

```php
<?php 

$send = email(array(
  'use'     => 'mail',
  'to'      => 'John Doe <john@doe.com>',
  'from'    => 'Max Musterman <max@musterman.com>',
  'subject' => 'My first Email',
  'body'    => 'Hello my friend! How are things going?'
));

$send = email(array(
  'use'     => 'amazon',
  'to'      => 'John Doe <john@doe.com>',
  'from'    => 'Max Musterman <max@musterman.com>',
  'subject' => 'My first Email',
  'body'    => 'Hello my friend! How are things going?'
));

$send = email(array(
  'use'     => 'postmark',
  'to'      => 'John Doe <john@doe.com>',
  'from'    => 'Max Musterman <max@musterman.com>',
  'subject' => 'My first Email',
  'body'    => 'Hello my friend! How are things going?'
));

?>
```

### Default values

Maybe you always want to use the same `to` or `from` address and you don't want to pass it each time when you call the plugin. This is where the default config values come in handy. Set them in your config file and you don't need to pass them each time. Here are the available default configurations:

```php

// set a default to address
c::set('email.to', 'John Doe <john@doe.com>');

// set a default from address
c::set('email.from', 'John Doe <john@doe.com>');

// set a default replyto address
c::set('email.replyto', 'John Doe <john@doe.com>');

// set a default subject
c::set('email.subject', 'This is my default subject');

```

### Disable sending emails

Sometimes it's handy to be able to switch off sending emails on the entire site. Maybe on the localhost for example. You can do that by adding the following rule to your config:

```php
c::set('email.disabled', true);
```
