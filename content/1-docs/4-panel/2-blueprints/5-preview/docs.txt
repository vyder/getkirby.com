The sidebar for each page contains a link, which will take panel users to the corresponding page. Sometimes it makes sense to reroute this link or hide it entirely. 

## Rerouting the preview link

In Kirby it's often useful to add subpages as data providers instead of real pages. A typical example would be a one-pager with subpages for each section or a contact page with multiple addresses, which are fed by subpages. In such a case the preview link should lead to the parent page and not to the subpage. 

For scenarios like this you have three available options to reroute the preview link:

### Parent

The preview link will lead to the parent page.

```
…
preview: parent
…
```

### First child

The preview link will lead to the first subpage of the current page.

```
…
preview: first-child
…
```

### Last child

The preview link will lead to the last subpage of the current page.

```
…
preview: last-child
…
```

## Hiding the preview link

The preview link can also be switched off entirely. In this case it will not be shown in the sidebar at all.

```
…
preview: false
…
```
