How to run Kirby on a local webserver using php on the command line

----

Text:

If you're command line addicted and you've already installed php, you can install and run Kirby 2 with just three lines:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/getkirby/starterkit.git
cd starterkit
php -S localhost:8000
```

You should now be able to reach your local server at <http://localhost:8000>.
