Kirby has a PHP error blocker built in by default, because showing PHP errors on a public site can be a security issue. But this also means that you will get a white screen, if you make a typo in your PHP code for your templates, snippets or plugins. 

So when you are developing a new Kirby site, it can be helpful to switch PHP errors back on. This can simply be done with a single config setting. Go to `site/config/config.php` 

```php

c::set('debug', true);

```

If you want to make sure that PHP errors are only visible on your local machine, you can setup a different config file for your production server. Please read more about it in the (link: blog/multi-environment-setup text: Multi-environment setup tutorial).
