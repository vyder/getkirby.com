Blueprints are the counterpart of each of your templates. They create individual forms in the panel which make it easy to insert the required data. Blueprints offer a wide set of options to customize those forms and even provide help to panel users while they enter data.

## Blueprint definition

Blueprints are defined in YAML. This is how a typical blueprint looks like:

```
title: Page
pages: true
files: true
fields:
  title:
    label: Title
    type:  text
  text:
    label: Text
    type:  textarea
```

This will create the following basic form:

Blueprints also control page settings like file uploads, numbering of subpages and more. You can find all available settings in the following chapters.
