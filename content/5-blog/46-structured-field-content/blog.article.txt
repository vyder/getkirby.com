With the (link: docs/content text: syntax for Kirby content files) it is very easy to (link: blog/any-content-you-like text: structure any kind of data) for your templates. But the latest release of (link: blog/1-0-8 text: Kirby) includes a brand new feature, which will give you even more data-structure-power – the YAML parser.

(link: http://www.yaml.org text: YAML) is a very simple, human-readable structure syntax. It's actually quite similar to the Kirby content syntax and a perfect match. With YAML you will be able to nest structured data inside your content fields. Sounds weird, so let me just show you some examples to demonstrate how it works:

## Example: nice addresses

If you are building a contact page and you've got just one address, so far you could simply structure the content like this for example…

	Title: Contact
	----
	Street: 15 Sesamestreet
	----
	ZIP: 9210
	----
	City: New York
	----
	Phone: 500-12131
	----
	Email: myawesome@email.com

But what happens, when you got more than just one address? Maybe your company has various offices all around the world or you are just very rich and you want to show off with the addresses of your houses on the Bahamas, New York, LA and in Monaco. 

One way would be to add subpages for each address and then build a foreach loop with `$page->children()` to display each address. But that would be quite an oversized solution for just showing more than one address. 

You could also add multiple fields like this: 

	Street_a: 15 Sesamestreet
	
	…	

	Street_b: 15 Sesamestreet
	
	…

	Street_c: 15 Sesamestreet
	
	etc. 

but that would be very nasty. 

With YAML syntax and the new YAML parser it becomes super easy to add more than just one address in one single field:
  
    Title: Contact
    ----
    Addresses:
    
    Monaco:
      Street: Rue de WTF 17
      ZIP:    1112
      City:   Monaco
      Phone:  555-1234
      Email:  me@monaco.org
          
    New York:
      Street: 1212 Broadway    
      ZIP:    4321
      City:   New York	
      Phone:  666-4321
      Email:  me@ny.org
    
    Bahamas: 
      Street: At the beach
      ZIP:    9999
      City:   The capitol of the Bahamas
      Phone:  777-9999
      Email:  me@bahamas.org

Looks pretty tidy, right? To see the full potential of YAML syntax, check out the (link: http://yaml.org text: YAML) site or the (link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML#Sample_document text: YAML Wikipedia entry)   

## How to access data

In your template you can parse YAML like this:

```php
<?php $addresses = yaml($page->addresses()) ?>
```

This will give you a nice associative array:

```
Array
(
    [Monaco] => Array
        (
            [Street] => Rue de WTF 17
            [ZIP] => 1112
            [City] => Monaco
            [Phone] => 555-1234
            [Email] => me@monaco.org
        )

    [New York] => Array
        (
            [Street] => 1212 Broadway
            [ZIP] => 4321
            [City] => New York
            [Phone] => 666-4321
            [Email] => me@ny.org
        )

    [Bahamas] => Array
        (
            [Street] => At the beach
            [ZIP] => 9999
            [City] => The capitol of the Bahamas
            [Phone] => 777-9999
            [Email] => me@bahamas.org
        )

)
```

**Hint:** Use `a::show($array)` to inspect the content of any array or object.

You can now use a simple foreach loop to build HTML for all addresses:

```

<?php foreach($addresses as $address): ?>
<div class="address">
  
  <?php echo $address['Street'] ?><br />
  <?php echo $address['ZIP'] ?> <?php echo $address['City'] ?>
    
  …  

</div>
<?php endforeach ?>

```

This works also great in connection with (link: http://microformats.org text: Microformats)

## More ideas

As you can see this will give you a lot more control and structure for your content. It's not limited to addresses though:

### A list of profiles

    Title: Elsewhere

…or whatever structured data you need!
