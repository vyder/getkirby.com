(link: http://roylodder.com text: Roy Lodder) has come up with another great extension for Kirby: (link: https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-extensions/blob/master/plugins/readlater/ text: The Read Later Plugin)

You can use the plugin to provide handy links for your visitors to save the current page or article with (link: http://instapaper.com text: Instapaper) or (link: http://getpocket.com text: Pocket). 

## Installation

Download the (link: https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-extensions/blob/master/plugins/readlater/readlater.php text: readlater.php) and put it in `site/plugins` Create the plugins folder if it is not there yet. 

## Usage

Once, the plugin is installed, you can instantly use it in your templates like this:

```

<article>
  <h1><?php echo html($page->title()) ?></h1>
  <?php echo kirbytext($page->text()) ?>

  <div class="readlater">
    <?php echo readlater($page->title(), 'instapaper') ?>
    <?php echo readlater($page->title(), 'pocket') ?>
  </div>

</article>

```

This will create two links: 

```
<a class="readlater instapaper" href="http://www.instapaper.com/hello2?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgetkirby.com%2Fblog%2Freadlater&title=Read+Later+Plugin">
  Add to Instapaper</a>
<a class="readlater pocket" href="https://getpocket.com/save?url=http%3A%2F%2Fgetkirby.com%2Fblog%2Freadlater&title=Read+Later+Plugin">
  Save to Pocket</a>  
```

…and you are free to style them with CSS and add them to your templates wherever you want.  

## Customization

If you don't want to use the default link texts (Add to Instapaper & Save to Pocket) you can use your own link texts: 

```
<?php echo readlater($page->title(), 'instapaper', 'Put this on Instapaper') ?>
<?php echo readlater($page->title(), 'pocket', 'Put it in my Pocket') ?>
```

### Options

You can also change the CSS selector, target and rel attribute for each link:

```php
<?php echo readlater($page->title(), 'pocket', 'Read later', array(
  'class'  => 'mycustomclass',
  'target' => '_blank',
  'rel'    => 'somerelattribute'
)); ?>
```

## Get involved

It would be great to have support for (link: http://readability.com/ text: Readability) or other sharing/read later services. The plugin is very easy to extend, so just get involved and (link: https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-extensions/blob/master/plugins/readlater/ text: fork the plugin on Github).
