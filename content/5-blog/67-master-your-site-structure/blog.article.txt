On modern sites and web applications Ajax is all over the place. It's a simple combination of JavaScript and server-side code, which makes it possible to update content on your site dynamically without refreshing the page. 

Kirby is very Ajax-friendly and this tutorial will show you how to build some simple ajaxified parts into your site. 

## jQuery to the help

I will use (link: http://jquery.com/ text: jQuery) to handle all the Ajax calls, but of course this can be done with any other Javascript framework or plain Javascript. 

### Embedding jQuery

Like you would with any other external Javascript file, you can either use the standard `<script>` tags in your header or footer snippets or you can embed Javascript Kirby-style: 

```php
<?php echo js('assets/javascript/jquery.js') ?>
<?php echo js('assets/javascript/scripts.js') ?>
```

I will use a second `scripts.js` to store all the custom Javascript, we will need.
I prefer to embed Javascript right before the closing body tag, but you can of course also place it in the head of your HTML.

## The site structure

For this example I'm going to use the default site structure, which is being shipped with Kirby. 

```
- 01-about-us
- 02-projects
-- 01-project-a
-- 02-project-b
-- 03-project-c
